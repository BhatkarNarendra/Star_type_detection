# Star_type_detection

Classifying stars in astronomy is a vital and significant undertaking that enhances our understanding of celestial phenomena. This project aims to employ the logistic regression method within machine learning to classify stars according to their diverse attributes, including color, luminosity, and more. The objective is to develop a predictive model capable of categorizing stars into various classifications, such as main sequence, red giant, white dwarf, and others, through logistic regression.
